Manifesto Site

Open `index.html` in your browser to view the single-page site that captures the manifesto's vibe: open-ended, looping, and slightly unfinished.

Files:
- index.html — the page
- styles.css — styles and animations
- script.js — small interaction (loose thread)

To run locally: simply open `manifesto-site/index.html` in any browser.
